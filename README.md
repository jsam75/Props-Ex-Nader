Props and Prop Drilling Exercises with Nader

These are props and prop drilling exercises from the Tech with Nader YouTube channel.  Prop drilling is a tangly mess to learn, but having a someone guide you through an exercise is extremely useful.  Although going through exercises is time consuming, I always learn at least a few valuable lessons.  More than just the exercises, I also learn how React behaves and have started to debug on my own when I get an error.

I have included all the exercise files (warmup + 3 exercises + bonus), but left exercise 3 active.  This one was the main prop drilling exercise.
